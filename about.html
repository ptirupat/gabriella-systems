                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    Founded with a passion for golf and cutting-edge technology, Gabriella Systems was created to revolutionize 
                    how golfers improve their game. We recognized that traditional golf instruction, while valuable, could be 
                    enhanced with the precision and objectivity that only artificial intelligence can provide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our journey began when our founder, frustrated with inconsistent golf performance despite regular lessons, 
                    envisioned a system that could analyze golf swings with the same precision as professional coaches, but 
                    available 24/7. Today, we're proud to offer the most advanced AI-powered golf video analysis platform.
